    A chemical engineering graduate with a great passion in programming <br>
    start taking a software courses and programming langauges .<br>

<h1 style=" text-shadow: 1px 1px #1a1a1a;;" >  My name is Asia, 24 </h1>  I’m skilled with PHP and Java, and I am trying to learn other programming languages,<br> step by step. Have two brothers, both of them study at a pharmacy school, so it is quite funny that I, as a girl,<br> decided for software engineering. 

I would introduce myself in seven words. Passionate coder,<br> responsible daughter, best colleague ever. That pretty much sums it up, though at least the last one<br> my former colleagues have to confirm. I try to do a good job in all roles I have in life,<br> and I enjoy the process immensely.<br> Do you want me to talk about my coding skills and experience now, or will we discuss it later in the interview?<br>
I’d introduce myself as a dreamer as well . I dream of working at Google,<br> working on applications billions of people use, having an impact on the world with my work. Sure enough, I know you receive hundreds of job applications for every single job opening, and I am not the only dreamer waiting for his chance.
